    <p>In the beginning was the Word. Western civilization rests upon those words. And yet there is a lively group of thinkers who believe that in the beginning was the Act. that nothing can precede actionâ€”no breath before act, no thought before act, no pervasive love before some kind of act.

I believe the poem is an act of the mind. I think it is easier to talk about the end of a poem than it is to talk about its beginning. </p></div>

An act of the mind. To move, to make happen, to make manifest. Be an act of Congress. A state of real existence rather than possibility.
