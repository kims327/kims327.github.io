<h1>Choice Feminism</h1>
<h2>I was banned from wearing pants in my middle school and high school—just because I am a girl. One day, our history teacher told the class that we “deserve” the objectifications because we are the ones who are objectifying ourselves by wearing short skirts and tight shirts. Women are told to dress up in a certain way that guys want, but when it comes to experiencing sexual harassment, the blame is on women. The male gaze often turns women into objects, and women, on a daily basis, fight to be recognized as people not objects. Women have rights to wear what they want just like any other person, and any sexual harassment or objectification cannot be justified regardless of what clothing they wear.</h2>
