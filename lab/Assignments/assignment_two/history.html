<h1>HISTORY& CONTEXT</h1>
<h2>“Humanity is male, and man defines woman, not in herself, but in relation to himself; she is not considered an autonomous being.” -Simone de Beauvoir, The Second Sex</h2>
<p>In the feminism history, there were third waves so far, and each wave led to another causing different movements. The first wave, which occurred in the 19th and 20th century, refers to the movement to obtain the women’s right to vote which lasted 72 years. The women’s movement from the 1960s to 1970s refers to the second wave feminism, and during that movement, a lot of strong women fought for women rights, including “the right to divorce, vote, study, work, enjoy consensual sex, compete in team sports, abort a fetus or escape violent partners,”2 which many of us might take for granted these days. Alongside fighting for women’s rights, “dress and personal appearance became an explicit part of some feminists’ political goals of challenging broader conceptions of gender and traditional femininity, and this brought conflicts among gender equality, sex work, or heterosexuality.”3 Consequently, a movement conveying the idea that feminism should simply give women choices and not pass judgment on what they choose occurred in the 1990s, which is referred to as third wave feminism.</p>

<p id="mobile">Third wave feminism, also referred to as the “choice feminism,”4 focuses on giving women choices, making them the subjects in their lives. Syder-Hall, the author of the article Third-Wave Feminism and the Defense of ‘Choice,’ mentions how feminists in the second wave were more focused on fighting for women rights like gender equality in the workplace or abortion rights, while today’s activists look at a wider range of topics through the feminist lens. Third wave feminism gives women choices. Instead of criticizing what other women are doing, third wave feminists speak up and share their own struggles and issues. For example, even though a woman shows up in heels and lipsticks making it seem like she is reinforcing the patriarchal environment, it is her choice to reflect on her desires, and to think about how the choices she makes play a role of supporting the feminism system. 5 Yet, an alarming number of people still think sexual harassment or rapes can be justified when a woman is wearing “revealing” or “provocative” clothing, but it is just one of the choices women made just like any other ordinary decisions that we make in our lives. Women deserve to be treated as human beings just like how men are treated in this world. We deserve to be represented, heard, and not objectified.</p>
