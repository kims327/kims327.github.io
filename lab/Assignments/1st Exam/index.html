<h3>How I Organize Photos</h3>

			<blockquote>
			I never backup my phone or archive digital images to my desktop like others do. Even though I've been using iphone for several years, I still don't prefer using icloud since I find it very confusing. So I tend to keep all my digital images on my phone in Photos just the way they are.

				I would say the most important file from my Photos album would be 'favorites' album. I am a type of person who take 100 pictures at a time so I always end up with this massive scale album that contains over 19,000 pictures. 'Favorites' is a special album where I only pick images that I really love among 19,000 pictures. The number gets bigger as more pictures get accumulated to this Photos album but I would still say 'favorites' is the most inportant album for me since it contains images that I never want to lose.
